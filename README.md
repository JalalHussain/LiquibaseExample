<b>Liquibase Example</b>

A sample project demonstrating how Liquibase functionalities work. 

<b>Documentation</b>

Documentation has been added in order the code to be more understandable.

<b>Development Status</b>

This example on how to use liquibase is under development. you may find it not so organised, you may find it not 
so good but the work is in progress and hopefully it will serve its purpose. 

<b>Project Goals </b>

I always try to document every issue I face, every new concept I learn, and every idea I feel worth recording.
So this is an effort in order to make it simple to use liquibase or trying to demonstrate a way to make it simple so that more 
and more people learn more things with minimum efforts.
